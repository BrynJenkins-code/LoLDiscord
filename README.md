### Summary

This is a discord bot focused around servicing information from the League Of Legends official API. It implements a Machine Learning algorithm that uses data from played games to estimate the win probability of a given player in a live game. In addition to this, it implements python libraries to create bespoke images that display stats from previously completed games.

Functionality for this work has been depreciated by updates to the Riot Games Developer API and as such this project is no longer functional.
